        <h1>Beef chow mein</h1>
        <p>
          Swap your weekly takeaway for this healthy beef chow mein – it’s quick
          to cook and low in fat and calories

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Tender steak strips with chow mein noodles and vegetables in a tasty
          stir-fry sauce. I love this beef chow mein for a quick dinner that
          everyone enjoys. It's not spicy, just full of umami flavour. You can
          use whatever vegetables you have to hand, and even use them to replace
          the meat if you're looking for a meat-free easy dinner.

          <span class="black">
            Cook the noodles following pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat half
            the oil in a wok and stir-fry the beef over a high heat for 30
            seconds until browned. Tip onto a plate, set aside, then add the
            remaining oil to the wok. Stir-fry the onion and ginger until
            softened. Add a drop of water to prevent burning, if needed and cook
            covered for 2-3 mins.

          <span class="black">
            Stir in the mushrooms and garlic, and fry until they start to soften
            (around 3 mins), then add the beansprouts and cook for a minute or
            two more until piping hot.

          <span class="black">
            Mix the tamari and vinegar together in a small bowl with 2 tbsp
            water. Add the drained noodles to the wok, toss well, then add the
            tamari mixture, spring onions and the beef. Stir-fry for a few
            minutes until heated through. Season with plenty of black pepper and
            serve.
