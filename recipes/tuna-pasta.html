        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          I’ll be the first to tell you… salads do not have to be boring! We often associate the word “salad” with lettuce and croutons, but they can truly be so much more than that. With the right ingredients you can create an abundance of healthy, tasty, and delightful (and get this — totally lettuce free) salads.

          <span class="black">
            Boil the penne with the leek in a large pan of salted water following pack instructions, until al dente.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="black">
            Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pan over a medium-high heat and fry the tomatoes for a few minutes, until they start to burst and soften. Add the sweetcorn and cook for 2-3 mins to heat through. Drain the pasta and leeks, reserving a little of the pasta water. Tip the drained pasta and leeks into the pan with the tomatoes, then toss through the ricotta and tuna.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="black">
            Season with plenty of black pepper. If you want to loosen the consistency, stir in some of the reserved pasta water along with the chopped basil. Serve scattered with the whole basil leaves.
