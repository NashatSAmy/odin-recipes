    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my "kitchen sink" pasta dish, you can use whatever veggies or
      cheeses you have on hand. The combo sounds a little odd but you'll be
      surprised of the amount of flavor you get!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 small red onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ medium green bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
      <li>crushed red chili pepper to taste (optional)</li>
      <li>3 cups fresh spinach, or to taste, stems removed</li>
      <li>1 medium Roma tomato, diced</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) carton ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 large lemon, zested and juiced</li>
      <li>¼ cup cubed fresh mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and garlic; saute until softened, 5 to 10
        minutes. Season with salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and
        crushed red chili pepper. Add spinach and tomato towards the end of the
        saute process and cook until spinach has wilted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season ricotta cheese with more Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and
        onion powder. Stir seasoned ricotta cheese into the vegetable mixture
        with Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Heat over medium-high
        heat until heated all the way through, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Plate and top with mozzarella.</li>
    </ol>
